The rest of this README consist of the flow on how the application works. Hopefully this would serve as a good reference on how the application as well as the flow.

Once the user has access to the application, the application would show the user a list of the whole menu with picture for the correlating dish. Each dish would have the name of the dish, estimated preparation time, price, the origin of the dish, as well as a favorite button if the user like the dish. Each dish also have an add to card button to order.

The application also have a search bar below the "Cafetaria Apps" for user to use if they wish to search a particular dish. After user done picking from the menu, the user can proceed to go to Cart where the application would show how many total dish was ordered and the total price for the whole order. Once the payment has been made the user would wait for the estimated time before the dish would come to the user's table.
